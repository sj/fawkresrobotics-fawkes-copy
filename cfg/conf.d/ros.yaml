ros:
  # Set a custom node name, for example if multiple fawkes instances
  # share the same roscore. Set to special value $HOSTNAME to use short
  # hostname. Examples:
  # node-name: tims_fawkes
  # node-name: $HOSTNAME

  # Spin the ROS main loop asynchronously from the Fawkes main loop?
  # Synchronous is preferred. But this will block the ROSNodeThread for
  # example for long running service calls (where a Fawkes plugin provides
  # the service, since it is executed in the thread).
  async-spinning: true

  # Number of threads for asynchronous spinning
  async-num-threads: 4

  clock:
    # Frequency in Hz at which the clock should be published
    frequency: 100

  pcl:
    # The time interval which is used to search for new pointclouds in ROS.
    # This is the maximum time until a pointcloud from ROS is visible and usable in FAWKES
    ros-search-interval: 2.

  tf:
    # Use tf2 for communication with ROS.
    # This means using the tf2_msgs message types and publishing
    # static transforms to /tf_static.

    # This setting is only relevant is use_tf2 is set to false above.
