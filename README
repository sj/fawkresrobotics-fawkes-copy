Fawkes Robot Software Framework
===============================

Fawkes is a component-based Software Framework for Robotic Real-Time
Applications for various Platforms and Domains.

It is developed and is used for cognitive robotics real-time
applications like soccer and service robotics. It supports fast
information exchange and efficient combination and coordination of
different components to suit the needs of mobile robots operating in
uncertain environments.

Today, Fawkes consists of an efficient communication middleware with a
hybrid blackboard and messaging design, a flexible set of software
libraries to make developing robotic functionalities reasonably
simple, and a coherent development and run-time environment with tools
that make integrating and running robotic applications achievable.
But Fawkes also comprises a large set of plugins, software components
that implement typical robot functionality like self-localization,
path planning, perception, or behavior execution and monitoring.
Several robot platforms like the Robotino, Nao, or Roomba are
supported out-of-the-box. Fawkes also integrates with other software
frameworks like ROS or Player and integrates third party software like
MongoDB, RRDtool, CLIPS, or OpenNI. By using ideas from
aspect-oriented programming, and run-time requirement assertion by the
framework, it is easy to access these resources with only a few lines
of code.

You can find more information, news, and current projects on the
Fawkes website [1]. Documentation of the development tools, the
plugins, and how to start are available on the Fawkes Trac page [2].

Please do not hesitate to contact us should you have questions, for
example considering if Fawkes would fit your robot application [3].
