NAME
----
fflaser_deadspots - Calibrate dead spots for the Fawkes laser plugin

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*fflaser_deadspots* [-r 'host[:port]'] [-w 'sec'] [-n 'N'] [-c 'dist']
		  [-m 'margin_deg'] [-d] [-b] 'num spots'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This tool is used to calibrate dead spots for spinning laser
scanners. If a laser scanner is mounted, sometimes not the whole field
of view can be used, because mounting of other hardware requires
brackets or poles, creating regions where laser data is useless and
generally short, i.e. dead spots.

This tool reads laser data from the blackboard for a given number of
cycles, and thresholds it based on a given distance. It records a
given number of data sets and compares the threshold to the median of
each beam. Any laser beam that is shorted than the given distance is
considered to be in a dead spot. After registering all short beams,
adjacent beams are accumulated to dead spot regions. The configuration
information is then written to the configuration of the connected
Fawkes instance for later use (unless a dry run is performed). To
prevent false calibration the number of expected dead spots can be
supplied, to detect if there was not enough free space around the
robot during calibration.

OPTIONS
-------
 *-h*::
	Show usage instructions.

 *-r* 'host[:port]]'::
	The host and port of the Fawkes instance to connect to.

 *-w* 'sec'::
	Wait the given time in seconds before acquiring the data. This
	gives some time for last preparations, like removing a
	cable. The maximum wait time is 60 seconds, the default wait
	time is 10 seconds.

 *-n* 'N'::
	The number of measurements to use to calculate the median of
	the laser beam distance value to compare to the threshold. The
	default number of measurements is 100.

 *-c* 'dist'::
	The threshold distance. Laser beams below this distance are
	considered dead, longer once are good. The default threshold
	distance is 0.9 meters.
 *-m* 'margin_deg'::
	Add an extra margin of 'margin_deg' to each calculated dead
	spots, on both sides. Dead spots, that overlap after applying
	the margin are merged. The margin can be negative to shrink
	the regions. The margin is given in degrees as integer with a
	value range of [-359..359].

 *-d*::
	Do a dry run, i.e. do not write the calibration information to
	the configuration file but only print it to the console.

 *-b*::
	Write a fake laser scan to the blackboard interface
	"Laser720Interface::Laser Calibration", with "good" values
	having a distance of 1.0, and dead values a distance of 0.
	This allows for a quick inspection if the result matches the
	expectation. Stop showing the data with Ctrl-C when done.

 'num spots'::
	Expect to have 'N' dead spots. If a different number of dead
	spots is found abort and report an error.



EXAMPLES
--------

 *fflaser_deadspots 4*::
	Read measurements from Fawkes on localhost, calculate dead
	spots with the default values and expect 4 dead spots. Write
	the data back to the configuration when successful.

 *fflaser_deadspots -w 5 -n 200 -c 1.5 -m 1 -d 3*::
	Run the calibration, based on 200 measurements and a distance
	threshold of 1.5 meters, after waiting 5 seconds. Add a margin
	of 1 degree to calculated spots, expect 3 dead spots. Do not
	write data to the configuration (perform a dry run).
