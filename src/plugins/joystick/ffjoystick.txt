NAME
----
ffjoystick - Provide joystick via blackboard or print movements

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*ffjoystick* [-r 'host[:port]'] [-d 'dev'] [-l]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This tool is used to provide a joystick connected to the local machine
to a Fawkes instance via the blackboard, or to print debug output
about joystick data in the blackboard.

Generally, the joystick plugin should be preferred, because it
operates faster within Fawkes. This is especially useful for joysticks
communicating wirelessly with a USB dongle. For cabled joysticks
however, this may not be feasible. In such situations, the joystick
can be connected to a laptop or desktop, and the data is transmitted
via a remote blackboard connection to the robot.

In the second mode, the tool prints out changes to the joystick
blackboard interface. This can be used to verify and debug joystick
communication, and to ensure that data is written to the correct
blackboard.

Both modes are mutually exclusive. If -l is given on the command line,
the second mode will be used, regardless of other parameters.

OPTIONS
-------
 *-h*::
	Show usage instructions.

 *-r* 'host[:port]]'::
	The host and port of the Fawkes instance to connect to.

 *-d* 'dev'::
	Joystick device file to use, defaults to /dev/input/js0.

 *-l*::
	Listen to the blackboard for joystick changes and print them
	out to the console.


EXAMPLES
--------

 *ffjoystick -r myrobot*::
	Open the default local joystick and write the data to the
	blackboard on myrobot.

 *ffjoystick -r myrobot -l*::
	Listen to changes to the joystick blackboard interface and
	print them to stdout.
