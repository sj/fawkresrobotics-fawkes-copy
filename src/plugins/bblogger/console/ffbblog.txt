NAME
----
ffbblog - Fawkes blackboard log file tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*ffbblog* [-r 'host[:port]'] <command> 'file' ['params']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This tool operates on log files recorded using the bblogger plugin. It
reads the binary log file and prints human readable output to the
console. It can also enable or disable a currently ongoing logging
process.

The tool can watch log files as they are written (in a way similar to
the unix tool linkff:tail[1]). It can also print an entry at a
specific index, or the meta information about a log file. In replay
mode it will print the information to the console in the same timing
that it was recorded. Log files can be repaired, for example if the
logging process ended prematurely (e.g. because of a segfault in a
plugin you are debugging). It will update the meta information in the
file as required for other tool operations. It can enable or disable
logging in a currently running bblogger. Finally, the log files can be
converted to other formats compatible with other tools.

For replaying a log file to the blackboard use the fflogreplay plugin.

COMMANDS
--------
 *watch*::
	Watch the given file as it is written. This is useful if the
	bblogger plugin is currently running and writing updates to
	the given file.

 *info*::
	Show meta information about the given log file.

 *print* 'index' ['index'...]::
	Print one or more specified indexes. The indexes are given on
	the command line following the file names and must be in the
	available range that can be queried with the info command.

 *replay*::
	Replay the given log file with a timing similar to the one it
	had during recording.

 *repair*::
	Repair the given log file. It will check for certain
	unconsistencies in the log file which occur if the logging
	process is ended prematurely, and then repairs them.

 *enable*::
	Enable logging in a currently running bblogger. The -r
	parameter can be optionally supplied to connect to a remote
	Fawkes instance.

 *disable*::
	Disable logging in a currently running bblogger. The -r
	parameter can be optionally supplied to connect to a remote
	Fawkes instance.

 *convert* 'infile' 'outfile' 'format'::
	Convert the log file to a different format (see formats below
	for the available formats). After the input 'infile', two
	more parameters are expected. First the output file 'outfile'
	must be given followed by the desired output 'format'.

OPTIONS
-------
 *-h*::
	Show usage instructions.

 *-r* 'host[:port]]'::
	The host and port of the Fawkes instance to connect to.

FORMATS
-------
The following output formats are available for converting bblogger log
files.

Comma-separated Values (CSV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lines starting with # are considered comments. The very first line
contains a comment with the field names, followed by type and length
in braces. Fields are separated as data rows.

One row of data is written per line. It contains fields separated by
semicolons (;). Warning, strings that may contain semicolons are
currently not escaped.


EXAMPLES
--------

 *ffbblog info 'file.bblog'*::
	Show meta information of 'file.bblog'.

 *ffbblog replay 'file.bblog'*::
	Replay 'file.bblog' in real-time.

 *ffbblog convert 'in.bblog' 'out.csv' 'csv'*::
	convert the file 'in.bblog' to CSV format and write the
	converted data to 'out.csv'.
