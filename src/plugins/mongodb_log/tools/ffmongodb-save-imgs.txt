NAME
----
ffmongodb-save-imgs - Save PNG files from database images

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ffmongodb-save-imgs' [-h] [-o dir] [-f] [-d database] -c <collection> items...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program connects to a local MongoDB database and extracts raw RGB images
from a collection (typically recorded via the mongodb-log plugin), and stores
them as a series of PNG images.

OPTIONS
-------
  *-h*::
	Show help instructions.

  *-o* 'directory'::
	Write PNG images to the given output directory.

  *-f*::
	Use the filenames as stored in the database. If not given the images
	will be saved as a numbered sequence of the form 00000001, 00000002
	etc.

  *-d* 'database'::
	Name of the database to read from.

  *-c* 'collection'::
	Name of the collection to read from.

  'items'::
	Timestamps and time ranges for which to extract the images. Timestamps
	are given as the time since the epoch in milisecond precision. If two
	timestamps are given concatenated by ".." they are treated as start
	and end times of a time range.

VIDEO FROM AN IMAGE SEQUENCE
----------------------------
You can generate videos from an image sequence for example using a command
like this:

 *ffmpeg -r 24 -b:v 500000 -i openni-image-rgb-%08d.png video.mp4*::
	Create video.mp4  with 24fps at a bit rate of 500kbit from images of
	the given name pattern. Note that for older ffmpeg version the
	bitrate must be specified with just -b.

EXAMPLES
--------

 *ffmongodb-save-imgs -c openni_image_rgb 0..1355421345807*::
	Extract all images until 1355421345807.
