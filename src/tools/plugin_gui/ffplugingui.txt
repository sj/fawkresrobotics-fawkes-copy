NAME
----
ffplugingui - Watch and instruct the Fawkes plugin system

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*ffplugingui*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This GUI application allows for viewing the current status in terms of
loaded plugins. It also allows to order Fawkes to load or unload
plugins, and shows short descriptions of the plugins.

Use the connect button to connect to a Fawkes instance, click the
checkbox next to a plugin name to load or unload it.

If you would like a more condensed view set
/apps/fawkes/plugingui/description_as_tooltip to true. This will
remove the descriptive line from the main window and instead show it
as a tooltip if you stop the mouse over the plugin name.
