NAME
----
fvshmem - List and cleanup FireVision image shared memory segments

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*fvshmem* [-h] [-c] [-c[t]] [-l] [-m] [-i 'image_id' 'file']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
List, save, or cleanup shared memory segments created by
FireVision. FireVision stores images retrieved from cameras and lookup
tables in shared memory segments. Olugins can decide to create additional
segments. All shared memory segments have a unique ID.

A list of currently existing segments can be retrieved. For images a
snapshot can be written into a FireVision raw file. Segments might
require cleanup if the creating process has died without closing the
segments. You can also choose to cleanup segments of specified
types. Segments for which are currently used are detected and not
removed.

OPTIONS
-------
 *-h*::
	Show usage instructions.

 *-l*::
	List FireVision shared memory segments.

 *-c*['t']::
	Cleanup shared memory segments. A type 't' can be optionally
	passed to determine that only these segments should be cleaned
	up. The type can be either 'i' for images or 'l' for lookup
	tables. If empty both types are cleaned up.

 *-i* 'image_id' 'file'::
	Read the file from the shared memory image segment with the ID
	'image_id' and write it to 'file' as FireVision raw.
