fvviewer(1)
===========

NAME
----
fvviewer - View FireVision images from various sources

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*fvviewer* [options] -s 'shmem_id'
*fvviewer* [options] -n 'host[:port]/image_id'
*fvviewer* [options] -f 'file'
*fvviewer* [options] 'camera argument string'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Retrieve images via FireVision and display them in a X11 window.

In the first form the image is read from a shared memory image segment
with the given 'shmem_id' on the local host. The second form retrieves
the image via the network and FireVision Fountain connecting to the
given host (and optionally port) and reading the image for
'image_id'. The third format allows for reading an image from the
given file.

The last form is the most flexible as it allows you to pass in an
arbitrary camera argument string to open any camera supported by
FireVision.

All forms share common options described below. Additionally there are
keys that can be pressed in the window to influence the behavior. By
default the viewer will start with continuous mode disabled, that
means that the user needs to press the space button to retrieve the
next image.

OPTIONS
-------
 *-h*::
	Show usage instructions.

 *-c*::
	Start in continuous mode.

 *-s* 'shmem_id'::
	Open image from local shared memory segment with ID 'shmem_id'.

 *-n* 'host[:port]]/image_id'::
	Open image via the network. The argument defines the host and
	optionally port to connect to, and the 'image_id' to retrieve.

 *-j*::
	Retrieve images JPEG compressed (network retrieval only). This
	conserves bandwidth but also lowers the image quality.

 *-d* 'delay'::
	Delay in ms to wait before a new image is captured after the
	previous one has been received. This is especially useful for
	continuous local shared memory display.

 *-f* 'file'::
	Read image from 'file.

 *-o* 'shmem_id'::
	Write the incoming image into a local shared memory segment
	with the given ID. This can be used for quickly relaying
	images for debugging.

 *-v*::
	Verbose console output.

KEYS
----
 *c*::
	Toggle continuous mode.

 *r*::
	Rectify image. Asks for a rectification info file and will
	show the rectified image. The rectification is performed
	locally.

 *+/-*::
	Increase or decrease the delay by 5 ms respectively.

 *Shift-R*::
	Rectify image, but use the already loaded rectification file
	and do not query again. Only useful after *r* has already been
	used, for example to quickly toggle between the rectified and
	non-rectified versions.

 *Space*::
	Refresh the image (in non-continuous mode).

 *q/Esc*::
	Quit the viewer.


EXAMPLES
--------

 *fvviewer -n myrobot/my_image*::
	Read the image with the the ID my_image via the network from
	the host myrobot.
