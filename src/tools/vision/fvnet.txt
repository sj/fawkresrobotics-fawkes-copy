NAME
----
fvnet - Explore and retrieve from FireVision instances on the network

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*fvnet* -e
*fvnet* -s -n 'host[:port]]'
*fvnet* \<-i|-j|-c|-C> -n 'host[:port]]/id' 'file'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Explore FireVision instances on the network and interact with those
instances. In the first form the network is explored using mDNS-SD
service discovery to find FireVision Fountain instances. These are
then queried for existing images and lookup tables.

In the second form the available images and lookup tables are queried
from a specified host.

The third form finally allows for retrieving images and retrieving or
pushing colormaps reading from or writing to 'file'.

OPTIONS
-------
 *-h*::
	Show usage instructions.

 *-e*::
	Explore the local network using service discovery.

 *-s*::
	Query a particular FireVision Foutain instance for available
	images and colormaps.

 *-n* 'host[:port]][/id]'::
	The network string defining the host and optionally port to
	connect to. For interaction with a particular image or
	colormap the ID is passed.

 *-i*::
	Retrieve FireVision raw image defined with -n and write it to
	'file'. The '/id' suffix must be given with the appropriate ID.

 *-j*::
	Retrieve JPEG image defined with -n and write it to
	'file'. The '/id' suffix must be given with the appropriate
	ID.

 *-c*::
	Retrieve colormap defined with -n and write it to 'file'. The
	'/id' suffix must be given with the appropriate ID.

 *-c*::
	Send colormap from 'file' to host and ID defined with -n. The
	'/id' suffix must be given with the appropriate ID.


EXAMPLES
--------

 *fvnet -e*::
	Explore the network listing existing FireVision Fountain
	instances and querying each for images and colormap.

 *fvnet -i -n myrobot/my_image image.raw*::
