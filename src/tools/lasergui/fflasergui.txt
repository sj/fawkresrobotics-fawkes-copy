SYNOPSIS

[verse]
*fflasergui*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This GUI application allows for viewing laser scanner data
remotely. It connects to a Fawkes instance and reads the current data
from the blackboard and updates as new data comes in. It can show high
and low resolution laser interfaces, and visualize the data as beams,
end points, or hull. The data can be freely zoomed, moved, and rotated
by 90 degrees.
