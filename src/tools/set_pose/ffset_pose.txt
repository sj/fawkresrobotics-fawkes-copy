ffset_pose(1)
=============

NAME
----
ffset_pose - Set initial pose for self-localization

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*ffset_pose* [-r 'host[:port]'] [-i ID] [-t SEC] -- <x y theta|x y z qx qy qz qw>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This tool is used to instruct a self-localization component
implementing a LocalizationInterface to set an initial pose. Thus, it
allows to localize a robot in a given map.

The position is either given as a 2D pose as <x y theta> where (x,y)
is a position on the X/Y ground plane of the reference frame. Theta
is the orientation around the Z axis in radians. When given as a 3D
pose, the arguments are a full position (x,y,z) in the reference frame
and a quaternion in order (qx,qy,qz,qw) representing the orientation.

EXAMPLES
--------

 *ffset_pose -r localhost:1910 -t 2.0 --  0.0 0.0 0.0*::
	Set 2D pose at frame origin looking in X axis direction.

 *ffset_pose -r localhost:1910 -t 2.0 --  4.4  0.3 0.0  0.0 0.0 0.7 0.7*::
	Set full 3D position on local Fawkes and try for 2 seconds.
