      This interface is used to publish transforms. It aims to be as
      compatible as possible with ROS' tf library and is used
      extensively by the Fawkes tf library.

      For this to work properly it is crucial to have correct
      timestamp set (cf. Interface::set_timestamp()). Set this as
      close as possible to the time of when the data, from which the
      transform is computed, has been acquired.

    <field type="string" length="64" name="frame">
      Parent frame ID. The given transform is relative to the origin
      of this coordinate frame.
    </field>
    <field type="string" length="64" name="child_frame">
      The ID of the child frame. The child frame's origin is at the
      given point in the parent frame denoted by the transform.
    </field>
    <field type="bool" name="static_transform">
	    True if the transform is static, i.e. it will never change
	    during its lifetime, false otherwise.
    </field>
    <field type="double" length="3" name="translation">
      This array denotes the translation vector of the transform. The
      element indexes are ordered x, y, z, i.e. translation[0] is the
      X value of the translation vector.
    </field>
    <field type="double" length="4" name="rotation">
      This array denotes the rotation quaternion of the transform. The
      element indexes are ordered x, y, z, w, i.e. translation[0] is
      the X value of the rotation quaternion and translation[3] is the
      W value.
