      This interface provides access to data of inertial measurement
      units. It is based on the sensor_msgs/Imu data type for
      compatibility.

      Accelerations should be in m/s^2 (not in g's), and rotational
      velocity should be in rad/sec.

      If the covariance of the measurement is known, it should be
      filled in (if all you know is the variance of each measurement,
      e.g. from the datasheet, just put those along the diagonal). A
      covariance matrix of all zeros will be interpreted as
      "covariance unknown", and to use the data a covariance will have
      to be assumed or gotten from some other source.

      If you have no estimate for one of the data elements (e.g. your
      IMU doesn't produce an orientation # estimate), please set
      element 0 of the associated covariance matrix to -1. If you are
      interpreting this message, please check for a value of -1 in the
      first element of each covariance matrix, and disregard the
      associated estimate.
