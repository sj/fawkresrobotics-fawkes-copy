      Reference coordinate frame for the data.

    <field type="int32" name="visibility_history">
      The visibilitiy history indicates the number of consecutive positive or negative
      sightings. If the history is negative, there have been as many negative sightings
      (object not visible) as the absolute value of the history. A positive value denotes
      as many positive sightings. 0 shall only be used during the initialization of the
      interface or if the visibility history is not updated.

    <field type="double" length="4" name="rotation">
      Rotation quaternion relative to reference frame, ordered as (x, y, z, w).
    </field>
    <field type="double" length="3" name="translation">
      Translation vector from the reference frame's origin, ordered as (x, y, z).

    <field type="double" length="36" name="covariance">
      Row-major representation of the 6x6 covariance matrix.
      The orientation parameters use a fixed-axis representation.
      In order, the parameters are:
      (x, y, z, rotation about X axis, rotation about Y axis, rotation about Z axis)
